# BlueMap Death Markers

Adds temporary markers in the positions where players have died to [BlueMap](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap).

Fabric version of [BlueMapDeathMarkers](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapDeathMarkers)

To reload this plugin, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.

If you want specific players to not get death markers, you can hide them from BlueMap
by using a plugin like [BlueMapPlayerControl](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapPlayerControl) (not by me).
Or if you use fabric (what is logical if you are here) you can use [BlueMap Marker Manager](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bmarker) (this time by me).
