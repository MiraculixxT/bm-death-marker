Fabric version of [BlueMapDeathMarkers](https://github.com/TechnicJelle/BlueMapDeathMarkers)

To reload this plugin, just reload BlueMap itself with `/bluemap reload`.

If you want specific players to not get death markers, you can hide them from BlueMap
by using a plugin like [BlueMap Marker Manager](https://modrinth.com/plugin/bmarker).
